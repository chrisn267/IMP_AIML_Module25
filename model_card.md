# Model Card

## Model Description

**Input:** MNIST handwritten digit database

**Output:** A classification model which recognizes handwritten digits

**Model Architecture:** Simple Neural Network with 2 hidden layers and a dropout rate

## Performance

The basic model performs with an accuracy of 92%
The enhanced model with tuned hyper parameters performs with an accuracy of 97.5%

## Limitations

Only a simple model - the main purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian Optimization for tuning hyper parameters.
